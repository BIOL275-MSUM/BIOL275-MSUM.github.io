eBird Basic Dataset

## Workflow

In general, the process would look like this:

1.  Instructor downloads the entire data set (\> 150 GB) and extracts the portion you need.

2. You put your data into your project folder.

2.  You use the accompanying R package [auk: eBird Data Extraction and Processing in R](https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/auk/index.html) to:

    1.  Extract a subset of the data you are interested in
    2.  Do any necessary filtering

3.  You do additional data tranformation and graphing using **tidyverse** functions.

The package has a [vignette](https://cornelllabofornithology.github.io/auk/articles/auk.html) with quick start guide.
