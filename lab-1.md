# Hello World!

## Objectives

Your objective in this lab is to create an R Markdown document demonstrating that you have all the correct software installed and have successfully cloned a GitHub repository to your computer.

## Install software

Before you can do the rest of the lab, you must have three software programs installed on your computer:

1. R
2. RStudio
3. Git

See the **Getting Started** section for instructions on installing those programs.

## Create a GitHub account

GitHub is a website that hosts Git repositories online. Think of it as an online place for your code to live and a way to share it with others.

You will need a free account. If you already have a GitHub account you can skip this step.

### Create a new GitHub account

1. Go to https://github.com/
2. Create a free GitHub account
3. Be sure to add your name to your account profile so that GitHub users (your fellow students) can find you when we are working on collaborative assignments.
