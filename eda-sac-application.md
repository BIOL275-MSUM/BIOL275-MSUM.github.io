# SAC Application

NOTE: these instructions are from 2021 and will be updated for 2022 soon. The main difference will be that in 2022 you will complete your project in teams of 2-3 students rather than individually.

You will present the results of your [Exploratory Data Analysis Project](eda-project-instructions.html) at Minnesota State University Moorhead's [Andrew B. Conteh Student Academic Conference (SAC)](https://www2.mnstate.edu/sac/).

The purpose of the SAC is to showcase the work and talent of MSUM students through presentations, posters and creative works at a one day conference held at MSUM each April. The SAC provides student researchers with an opportunity to present their work to faculty, administration, peers and the community in a formal academic setting.

## Overview

### How to write an abstract

Your abstract should be one paragraph with 100-250 words. Below, I suggest 6-7 specific sentences to include, although your abstract can vary from this pattern depending on the nature of your question.

-   Two sentences of background explaining the "system". For example, if you are exploring the risk factors associated with diabetes, you might start by explaining what diabetes is, how you get it, and what other studies have found regarding risk factors.

-   One sentence laying out your question.

-   One sentence saying which data set you will use, and where it came from.

-   One or two sentence describing what you plan to do (i.e. which variables will you compare) to answer your question. Unless you have a good reason not to, you should probably use the phrase "exploratory data analysis" somewhere in here.

-   One sentence about the conclusions you might draw based on your results, the contribution this might make towards science, how a decision-maker might use this information, or some other way of explaining how your expected results might be used.

Write the abstract in first person future tense, for example "I will..."

For more information about how to write an abstract, see [<https://www.mnstate.edu/sac/preparing-presentation.aspx>](https://www.mnstate.edu/sac/preparing-presentation.aspx){.uri}

### How to write a title

Now that you have an abstract, it needs a title.

The title should be a single phrase or sentence, between 6 and 12 words long (this is flexible).

It should include important keywords related to your question, so that someone reading the title would have a good idea what the poster is about.

The title could be generic such as "the relationship between X and Y", or a declarative statement like in the example below. The title can omit some of the details included in the Question.

## Assignment: Submit your application

The process of presentation at the SAC begins with submitting an application using the [online application form](https://my.mnstate.edu/SAC/form/index).

Applications for the 2021 SAC are due [Sunday February 28, 2021.]{.text-danger}

The application deadline will not be extended for any reason.

### Before you begin

Before you begin the application process, you should read the [Exploratory Data Analysis Project](eda-project-instructions.html) instructions, choose the data set you will work with for the project, and write your abstract and title.

Assemble all the required information and have it ready to copy and paste into the application form. The application form will time out after 30 minutes, so if you do not complete it within that time, your information will be lost and you will have to start over.

You will need the following:

1.  Your Dragon ID

2.  Title (already written, spell checked, and approved by your mentor)

3.  Abstract (already written, spell checked, and approved by your mentor)

    -   Between 100 and 250 words
    -   See Abstract guidelines for help writing your abstract

4.  Name of your mentor (the course instructor, Dr. Chris Merkord)

*If* your presentation uses data collected as part of a research project you are involved in, and you need to credit other faculty or students, then you may add coauthors and additional mentors. In that case, you will also need to have ready:

5.  Dragon IDs of all student coauthors, and whether each is an honor student or a graduate student
6.  Names of additional faculty mentors
7.  Your IRB or IACUC approval, if applicable
