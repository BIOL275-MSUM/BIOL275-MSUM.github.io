# Downloading Files

When working on projects, you may need to download datasets, scripts, or other files from the internet. Here’s how to find and organize these files on your computer.

## Where Do Downloads Go?

By default, web browsers save files to the **Downloads** folder. Below are instructions for finding this folder in popular web browsers:

-   **Google Chrome**: Click the three-dot menu in the top-right corner → Select **Downloads** → Right-click the file and choose **Show in folder**.
-   **Mozilla Firefox**: Click the download icon in the toolbar → Click the folder icon next to the downloaded file.
-   **Microsoft Edge**: Click the three-dot menu in the top-right corner → Select **Downloads** → Click **Show in folder**.
-   **Safari (Mac)**: Click the download icon in the top-right corner → Click the magnifying glass next to the file to open its location.

## Moving Files to Your Project Folder

After downloading a file, you should move it to your R project folder. Follow the instructions based on your operating system.

### **Windows (File Explorer)**

1.  Open **File Explorer** (press `Win + E`).
2.  Navigate to the **Downloads** folder (usually under "This PC" \> "Downloads").
3.  Locate your downloaded file.
4.  Find your project folder. If using RStudio projects, it’s typically in **Documents** under a folder with your project’s name.
5.  Drag and drop the file from **Downloads** into your project folder.

### **Mac (Finder)**

1.  Open **Finder**.
2.  Click **Downloads** in the left sidebar.
3.  Locate your downloaded file.
4.  Find your R project folder. If using RStudio projects, it is likely in the **Documents** folder.
5.  Drag and drop the file from **Downloads** into your project folder.

### **Posit Cloud**

1.  Click the **Files** tab in the lower-right panel of Posit Cloud.
2.  If you downloaded a file, it may appear in your home directory.
3.  Use the **Upload** button in Posit Cloud to upload the file from your computer if needed.
4.  Use the **Move** button to move the file to the correct directory within your project.

## Finding Your R Project Folder

Your R project folder is where all files for your analysis should be stored. If you are unsure where your project folder is: - Open **RStudio** and check the **Files** pane (lower-right by default). - Click **More** (gear icon) → **Go to Working Directory**. - Alternatively, run the following command in RStudio to print your project directory:

```{r eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

-   The output will show the path to your current working directory.

## Summary

-   Find your downloads using your web browser’s **Downloads** section.
-   Move downloaded files to your **R project folder**.
-   Use **File Explorer (Windows)**, **Finder (Mac)**, or **Posit Cloud’s Files tab** to organize files.
-   Use `getwd()` in R to confirm your working directory.

Keeping your files organized is crucial for reproducible research and efficient workflow. Always ensure that your dataset and scripts are in your project folder before working in RStudio.
