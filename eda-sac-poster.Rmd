## Visual Editor

Once you have a template, the easiest way to write and style your poster is to use the Visual Editor. This allows you to use common text editor buttons to format your text, insert code chunks, images, and links, and more.

To switch to the visual editor, open your README.Rmd file and click the gear icon at the top of the source pane. Check "Use Visual Editor".

The Visual Editor requires RStudio version 1.4 or later. You can check your RStudio version by running `RStudio.Version()` . If you don't have it, update RStudio by installing the newest version.

If you don't want to use the Visual Editor, you can always format your poster using RMarkdown syntax. See [R Markdown Documents](r-markdown-documents.html) for more info.
