## Overview

A major part of the lab will be to develop your own data science project in R.

You will choose a dataset to use and a question to answer. You will present your results to the class and at the [MSUMâ€™s Andrew B. Conteh Student Academic Conference (SAC)](https://www.mnstate.edu/sac/) in April (application deadline is Feb. 25).

## Purpose

The purpose of the lab project is to provide you an opportunity to learn how to work with data, explore datasets, and perform statistical analyses in R while trying to answer a question that interests _you_.

## Datasets

You may choose one of the following datasets, or choose another publicly available dataset, or use your own dataset, for example if you are involved in an ongoing research project.

### Datasets in R

There are literally thousands of datasets available in R

### Other public datasets

Here are some ideas for other public datasets. You will have only a short time to acquire your dataset.

- [eBird data](https://ebird.org/science) on bird observations

And finally, the internet has lots of other lists of datasets, for example:

- [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets). A topic-centric list of high-quality open datasets in public domains. By everyone, for everyone!
