# SAC Presentation

You will present the results of your [Exploratory Data Analysis Project](eda-project-instructions.html) at Minnesota State University Moorhead's [Andrew B. Conteh Student Academic Conference (SAC)](https://www2.mnstate.edu/sac/).

The purpose of the SAC is to showcase the work and talent of MSUM students through presentations, posters and creative works at a one day conference held at MSUM each April. The SAC provides student researchers with an opportunity to present their work to faculty, administration, peers and the community in a formal academic setting.

## Application

The process of presentation at the SAC begins with submitting an application using the [online application form](https://my.mnstate.edu/SAC/form/index).

Applications for the 2021 SAC are due [Sunday February 28, 2021.]{.text-danger}

The application deadline will not be extended for any reason.

### Before you begin

Before you begin the application process, you should assemble all the required information and have it ready to copy and paste into the application form. The application form will time out after 30 minutes, so if you do not complete it within that time, your information will be lost and you will have to start over.

You will need the following:

2.  Title (already written, spell checked, and approved by your mentor)

3.  Abstract (already written, spell checked, and approved by your mentor)

    -   Between 100 and 250 words
    -   See Abstract guidelines for help writing your abstract

4.  Name of your mentor (the course instructor, Dr. Chris Merkord)

*If* your presentation uses data collected as part of a research project you are involved in, and you need to credit other faculty or students, then you may add coauthors and additional mentors. In that case, you will also need to have ready:

5.  Dragon IDs of all student coauthors, and whether each is an honor student or a graduate student
6.  Names of additional faculty mentors
7.  Your IRB or IACUC approval, if applicable
