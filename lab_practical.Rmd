## Format of the practical

You will demonstrate in lab using R and RStudio that you know how to create a project, save data files into it, create an R script, and write R code. I will grade the assignment in lab when you are finished with it, before you leave.

## Practice example

```{r create-example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1)
tibble(
  A = rnorm(10, 5, 1),
  B = rnorm(10, 10, 2),
  C = rnorm(10, 20, 4)
) %>% 
  gather(species, height) %>% 
  mutate(add = rnorm(30, 1, .1),
         mult = rnorm(30, 3, .1),
         weight = (height + add) * mult) %>% 
  select(-add, -mult) %>% 
  write.csv("sample-data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

You will be given a dataset and a prompt. Here is an example:

1. Create a new project in RStudio
    - Claim your repository
    - Use the Version Control + GitHub method to clone the repository to your computer.
2. Save [sample-data.csv](sample-data.csv) into your project directory. Mac users will need to Ctrl+click and select Download File.
3. Load the tidverse package. This is the only package you will need.
3. Create a new R script and save it into the project directory.
3. Read the dataset and left assign it to an object in the R environment
4. Select only the variables species, height, and weight.
5. Filter variable Species to exclude species "C".
6. Group by Species and summarize, calculating the mean, variance, and sample size (n) of each group. Don't forget to ungroup afterwards.
7.	Calculate a new variable for standard error using the formula `se = sqrt(var/n)`.
8. Create a ggplot showing a histogram of height with facets for Species.
9.	Create a ggplot showing a scatterplot of height and weight.
