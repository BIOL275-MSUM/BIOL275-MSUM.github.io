# Laptop Setup

Most students use the computers in the lab room to complete their labs. These computers already have all the necessary software installed, so you don't have to do anything to get started.

Some students may want to work on their own personal laptop or desktop computer instead of, or in addition to, the lab computers. If that is the case, you have two basic options:

-   [Option 1: Use Posit Cloud], an online service that is essentially R, RStudio, and Git, all in a web browser. The only requirement is that you have an internet connection. See Posit Cloud below for instructions.

-   [Option 2: Install the software] on your machine, including R, RStudio, and Git; see the next three sections for instructions.

## Option 1: Use Posit Cloud

If you don't want to install the software on your computer, The easiest way to use R, RStudio, and Git on your own computer is to use Posit Cloud <https://rstudio.cloud/> in a web browser.

You have to create a free account, and you get 25 compute hours a month for free. That translates to 50 hours of having the project open, which is probably enough for most student uses.

## Option 2: Install the Software

If you really want to install the software on your own computer, here are instructions. Know that campus IT will probably not offer any help with this.

The three software programs you need to install are:

-   Install R

-   Install RStudio

-   Install Git

### Install R

You must install R before you install RStudio.

Directions for installing R:

1.  Go to <https://cran.rstudio.com/>
2.  Under *Download and Install R*, follow the link for your operating system, Linux, (Mac) OS X, or Windows.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/download-r.png")
```

3.  If you chose Download R for (Mac) OS X:

    a.  Download the binary file. The link will say something like "R-`paste0(R.Version()$major, ".", R.Version()$minor)`.pkg", but the version number may be different if a newer version has been released.
    b.  Open the file and your Mac will install R. If you are prompted for options during installation, just select the default options.

4.  If you chose Download R for Windows:

    a.  Click the link for "base" or "install for the first time"
    b.  Download the installer. The link will say something like "Download R 4.0.3 for Windows", but the version number may be different if a newer version has been released.
    c.  Open the file and Windows will install R. If you are prompted for options during installation, just select the default options.

### Install RStudio

Make sure you have installed R before you try to install RStudio.

Directions for installing RStudio:

1.  Go to <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>
2.  Scroll down about two thirds of the page. You will see a heading that says RStudio Desktop `RStudio.Version()$version`.
3.  Click the big blue button that says "DOWNLOAD STUDIO FOR WINDOWS"

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshots/download-rstudio.png")
```

### Install Git

Git can be installed on Windows, MacOS, or Linux.

For instructions, see the [Install Git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git) chapter of [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan.

If you think you may have git already installed, or you just want to check, see the instructions in [Git already installed?](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git#git-already-installed) Although you can follow the directions to launch a shell [from within RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/shell#from-within-rstudio), you can also just click the Terminal tab in RStudio (next to the Console tab).

Additional help installing Git may be found on the Git Documentation site at [1.5 Getting Started - Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

# Git Setup

To use Git, you must first give it some information. This needs to be done once on each computer you use and once in Posit Cloud if you are using that. If you are using a computer in a campus computer lab, all your documents and git settings are deleted each day, so you will need to do this step each time you sign in.

## Introduce yourself to Git

Whether you use Posit Cloud or install the software yourself, you will need to introduce yourself to Git before you can start using it. Quick instructions are provided below. For more detailed instructions, see [Introduce yourself to Git (happygitwithr.com)](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git) and the Git documentation [1.6 Getting Started - First-Time Git Setup (git-scm.com)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

What does "introduce yourself" mean? Basically it just means you need to give Git a name and email address it can attach to all the commits (changes) you make to your repositories.

There are two ways to introduce yourself: 1) by using the shell, or 2) via code in an R script. The shell works best if you need to do it once, for example if you are using Posit Cloud or have installed the software on your own computer. An R script works best if you are using a campus computer lab where your account is deleted at the end of every day.

### Option 1: Use the shell

One way to introduce yourself is to use the command line in a shell. A shell is a simple program on your computer that lets you run commands to do things. Every Windows, macOS, or Linux computer has one, even if you've never seen it. You may also the shell called a "terminal" or "command line".

STEP 1: Open a Git command line in one of the following three ways (the first is the easiest):

-   In RStudio running on any computer or in Posit Cloud, do one of the following:

    -   Click the Terminal tab in RStudio (bottom left pane next to the Console tab) or use the keyboard shortcut Alt+Shift+M
    -   Click the Git tab in RStudio (top right pane), click the More icon (a blue gear), and click Shell... which will open a shell window

-   In Windows:

    -   run the application Git CMD, for example by clicking on the icon in the Windows Start Menu

-   In macOS:

    -   open a command line

Step 2: Run the following two commands.

``` bash
$ git config --global user.name "Jane Doe"
$ git config --global user.email janedoe@example.com
```

replacing the example name and email address with your own. The username can be whatever you want, but I recommend your first and last name. The email address should be the one associated with your GitHub account.

You should enter one command, press enter, then enter the second command, and press enter.

Note, do not enter the \$ sign at the beginning, that is just how we note a command prompt.

Note, the username needs double quotes around it because it contains a space. The email does not, although it doesn't hurt anything to use quotes there as well.

You can check to make sure the commands work by printing the global configuration settings with this command:

``` bash
git config --global --list
```

You should see your user name and user email listed there.

### Option 2: Use R code

This option works well if you are using a campus computer lab where your account is deleted at the end of every day. Thanks to [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git) for the inspiration for this.

This method requires the [usethis package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/), so you will first need to install the package. Then run:

```{r}
# install if needed:
# install.packages("usethis")

library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Kari Nordmann", user.email = "kari@example.org")
```

You can install the package by highlighting that line without the comment character and running it.

Note: this only needs to be run once until your user account is deleted from the computer, but it doesn't hurt to run it again.
