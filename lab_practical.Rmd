## Format of the practical

You will demonstrate in lab using R and RStudio that you know how to create a project, save data files into it, create an R script, and write R code. I will grade the assignment in lab when you are finished with it, before you leave.

## Practice example

```{r create-example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1)
tibble(
  A = rnorm(10, 5, 1),
  B = rnorm(10, 10, 2),
  C = rnorm(10, 20, 4)
) %>% 
  gather(species, height) %>% 
  mutate(add = rnorm(30, 1, .1),
         mult = rnorm(30, 3, .1),
         weight = (height + add) * mult) %>% 
  select(-add, -mult) %>% 
  write.csv("sample-data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

You will be given a dataset and a prompt. Here is an example:

1. Create a new project in RStudio
    - Claim your repository
    - Use the Version Control + GitHub method to clone the repository to your computer.
2. Save [sample-data.csv](sample-data.csv) into your project directory. Mac users will need to Ctrl+click and select Download File.
3. Load the tidverse package. This is the only package you will need.
4. Create a new R script and save it into the project directory.
5. Read the dataset and left assign it to an object in the R environment
6. Calculate the mean and standard error of height for species A and B only. The output should be a tibble with exactly three columns: species, mean height, and standard error of height.
    - Filter variable Species to exclude species "C".
    - Group by Species and summarize, calculating the mean, variance, and sample size (n) of each group. Don't forget to ungroup afterwards.
    - Calculate a new variable for standard error using the formula `se = sqrt(var/n)`.
    - Remove all columns except the three requested
7. Create a ggplot showing a histogram of height with facets for Species (showing all three species)
8. Create a ggplot showing a scatterplot of height and weight.  (using all three species)
