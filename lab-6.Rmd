# Comparing means

## Objectives

In this lab, you will learn to:

-   Estimate the mean and confidence interval of a numerical variable for two or more groups
-   Plot the distribution of a numerical variable for two or more groups
-   Compare the means of two groups using a two-sample t-test
-   Compare the means of three or more groups using an ANOVA

## Introduction

A two-sample t-test compares the means of a numerical variable from two separate groups. An ANOVA compares the means of a numerical variable from more than two groups.

In each of these tests, group membership can be thought of as a categorical variable.

The basic ANOVA can be extended to more complicated scenarios. For example, a two-way ANOVA estimates how the means of a numerical variable vary in response to two categorical variables. This lab only deals with one-way ANOVAs.

## Data

For this lab, we will use the `penguins` dataset from the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/index.html) package (Horst et al. 2020).

### Installation

You can install the release version of palmerpenguins from CRAN using the Packages tab in RStudio or with:

```{r install-palmerpenguins, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

This only needs to be done once on your computer, so it's best not to put this in your R script. If you do put it in, prefix it with a comment so it does not run each time your run through your script:

```{r comment-install}
# install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

Then load the package. While you're at it, go ahead and load the tidyverse too, because we will also use that in this lab:

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

While not required to access the data, it is nice to see the dataset in your Environment. You can load the `penguins` dataset with:

```{r load-data}
data("penguins")
```

You should now see two datasets in your Environment, `penguins` and `penguins_raw`. For this lab we will use `penguins` only. The details for each dataset will not be shown in the Environment tab until you use them (see the next section), a result of something called lazy-loading, which prevents the dataset from taking up memory until you need to use it.

### About the data

The dataset `penguins` contains data for 344 penguins, of 3 different species, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

```{r head-penguins}
head(penguins)
```

The three islands include Torgersen, Biscoe, and Dream while the three species of penguins include Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adélie.

For each penguin (i.e. row, i.e. observation, i.e. case), has measurements for bill length (mm), bill depth (mm), flipper length (mm), body mass (g), sex (male or female), and year (2007, 2008, 2009).

Bill length, or more specifically culmen lenght, is the distance from the tip of the bill to the base of the upper mandible. Bill depth is the distance from the top of the bill to the bottom at the base of the bill.

Looking at the structure of the dataset, you can see that species, island, and sex are factors, bill_length_mm and bill_depth_mm are doubles, and the other variables are integers.

```{r structure-penguins}
str(penguins)
```

## Compare two groups

### Sexual dimorphism

Many bird species show a pattern of sexual dimorphism, with males averaging larger than females. In some groups, however, many species show reverse sexual dimorphism, with females averaging larger than males. This is most common in birds of prey including Falconiformes (falcons), Strigiformes (owls), and Accipitriformes (hawks, eagles, kites, etc.).

The term "bird of prey" is a somewhat ambiguous term for species that primarily hunt and feed on vertebrates. Penguins fit that description, but have not historically been considered "birds of prey".

Let's explore the penguins dataset to see if there is evidence of either type of sexual dimorphism in these species:

```{r strip-chart-sex, fig.height=7, fig.width=5}
penguins %>% 
  select(
    species,
    sex,
    bill_length_mm, 
    bill_depth_mm, 
    flipper_length_mm, 
    body_mass_g
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    col = where(is.numeric),
    names_to = "variable", 
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = sex, y = value)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = sex)) +
  facet_grid(variable ~ species, scales = "free_y", switch = "y") +
  labs(y = NULL) +
  guides(color = "none") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(strip.placement = "outside")
```

There certainly appears to be some difference between males and females, at least for some morphological characteristics and species.

### Adélie bill depth

Let's dig in an look more closely at one variable and one species: Adélie Penguins and bill depth.

```{r adelie-bill-depth}
adelie_bill_depth <-
  penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>% 
  select(sex, bill_depth_mm) %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>% 
  print()
```

As you can see, there are 146 Adélie penguins in the dataset.

### Distribution of bill depths by sex

Next, let's see how the variable bill depth is distributed in each sex:

```{r adelie-bill-depth-histogram}
adelie_bill_depth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(
    aes(fill = sex), 
    bins = 15, 
    alpha = 0.5, 
    position = "identity"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","cyan4")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The distributions are not perfectly normal, but the general hump shape is close enough that we should feel comfortable assuming they are normally distributed for the purpose of estimating population parameters and conducting hypothesis tests.

### Mean bill depth by sex

Next we will estimate the mean bill depth for each sex and put a 95% confidence interval around those estimates:

```{r adelie-bill-depth-summary}
adelie_bill_depth_summary <-
  adelie_bill_depth %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    mean = mean(bill_depth_mm),
    sd = sd(bill_depth_mm),
    sem = sd/sqrt(n),
    upper = mean + 1.96 * sem,
    lower = mean - 1.96 * sem
  ) %>% 
  print()
```

Here we can see that the confidence intervals for our estimates of the mean bill depth for each each sex do not overlap. To make it more clear, let's plot it:

```{r adelie-bill-depth-means, fig.width = 4}
adelie_bill_depth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = sex), 
              shape = 16, alpha = 0.3, width = 0.4) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(y = mean, ymax = upper, ymin = lower), 
                data = adelie_bill_depth_summary, width = .1) +
  geom_point(aes(y = mean), 
             data = adelie_bill_depth_summary) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","cyan4")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  guides(color = "none")
```

The non-overlapping confidence intervals can be seen clearly in the above figure.

### $t$-test

To compare the means using a hypothesis test, we can use a two-sample t-test.

The null hypothesis would be that the mean bill depths of females and males are equal. The alternative hypothesis would be that the mean bill depths of females are males are not equal.

Now we can use the function `t.test()` to conduct the t-test. The first argument will be a formula specifying how the variables are related. The numerical (response) variable should go first, followed by a tilde `~`, then the categorical (explanatory) variable. The other required argument is the name of the dataset.

```{r t-test}
ttest_results <- t.test(formula = bill_depth_mm ~ sex, data = adelie_bill_depth)
ttest_results
```

The output shows several things:

-   the two variables involved
-   the test statistic $t$
-   the degrees of freedom
-   the $P$-value
-   the alternative hypothesis
-   the 95% confidence interval of the *difference* in the two means
-   the estimated mean for each group

In this case, the $P$-value is `1.914e-15`, which is scientific notation for 0.000000000000001914. If we choose an alpha level of $\alpha=0.05$, then $P < \alpha$, so we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis by default.

You can find the difference in the two means like this:

```{r difference}
unname(diff(ttest_results$estimate))
```

To conclude: Female Adélie Penguins are 1.45 mm shorter than males (95% CI 1.13--1.77). The difference is statistically significant ($t = -8.928$, $df = 143.15$, $p = 1.914e-15$).

## Compare three groups

### Distribution of bill depths by species

For the next exercise, we will compare the mean bill depth among three groups: the three species of penguins. First, let's look at the distribution of bill depths for each species:

```{r bill-depth-species-histogram}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(
    aes(fill = species), 
    bins = 15, 
    alpha = 0.5, 
    position = "identity",
    na.rm = TRUE
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange", "darkorchid", "cyan4")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

It certainly appears that Gentoo Penguins have shorter bills than the other two species.

### Mean bill depth by species

Next, we will estimate the mean bill depth for each species and put a confidence interval around each estimate:

```{r bill-depth-means}
bill_depth_means <-
  penguins %>% 
  filter(!is.na(bill_depth_mm)) %>%      # remove missing values
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean = mean(bill_depth_mm),
    sd = sd(bill_depth_mm),
    n = n(),
    sem = sd / sqrt(n),
    upper = mean + 1.96 * sem,
    lower = mean - 1.96 * sem
  ) %>% 
  print()
```

And here are those means and confidence intervals plotted over the raw data:

```{r bill-depth-jitter}
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = species, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = species),
              width = 0.1,
              alpha = 0.7,
              show.legend = FALSE,
              na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(y = mean, ymin = lower, ymax = upper), 
                data = bill_depth_means,
                width = .1, position = position_nudge(.3)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = mean), data = bill_depth_means,
             position = position_nudge(.3)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","darkorchid","cyan4"))
```

The graph, which depicts the mean 95% confidence interval for the bill depth of each species, indicates there is likely a statistically significant difference between the means.

### ANOVA

To test this hypothesis, we can use a one-way ANOVA, which tests for differences among the means of multiple groups.

The hypotheses for an ANOVA can be state like this:

-   $H_0$: the mean bill depth is equal among all species
-   $H_A$: At least one bill depth is different from the others

The `aov()` function fits an analysis of variance model to the data. The first argument is the formula specifying how the variables are related, just like the $t$-test, with the numerical response variable, a tilde, and the categorical explanatory variable. The other argument is the data frame.

```{r anova}
aov_bill_depth_species <-
  aov(bill_depth_mm ~ species, data = penguins)
aov_bill_depth_species
```

Printing the results of the ANOVA, as seen above, gives you some information about the test, but using the `summary()` function gives you more details:

```{r aov-summary}
summary(aov_bill_depth_species)
```

ANOVA works by comparing the variance within groups to the variance between groups. The test statistic is the $F$-ratio, where $F=MS_{groups}/MS_{error}$. Under the null hypothesis, F would be close to 1, while under the alternative hypothesis F would be greater than 1. The $P$-value represents the probability of obtaining an F-ratio as great as or greater than the one you obtained. If the $P$-value is less than your alpha level, you can reject the null hypothesis.

In this case, the $P$-value of `2e-16` is below a any alpha level we might choose, so we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the mean bill depth for at least one species is different from the means for the other species.

### Questions

### $t$-test question

This question is taken from your textbook:

Researchers studying the number of electric fish species living in various parts of the Amazon basin were interested in whether the presence of tributaries affected the local number of electric fish species in the main rivers (Fernandes et al. 2004).

They counted the number of electric fish species above and below the entrance point of a major tributary at 12 different river locations.

The data is provided in your GitHub repository.

For each question below, write a sentence answering the question *and* show the code you used to come up with the answer, if applicable.

A.  Test the hypothesis that the tributaries have no effect on the number of species of electric fish.
B.  What is the difference in the mean numbers of species between areas upstream and downstream of a tributary? What is the 95% confidence interval of this difference in means?
C.  State the assumptions that you had to make to complete parts (A) and (B). Create a graph to assess whether one of those assumptions was met (hint: a histogram for each group).
