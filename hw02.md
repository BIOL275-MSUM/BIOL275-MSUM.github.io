Homework 2
================
Updated 2017-01-17

The purpose of Lab 2 is to show you how to import datasets into R, inspect them, and perform some basic manipulations on them.

You will work through some chapters in the lab textbook and "turn in" your homework by pushing your files to a GitHub repository for Homework 2.

Project setup
-------------

You will create a new RStudio project and Git repository for this assignment, just like you did for [Homework 1](hw1.md) last week.

As a reminder, here are the instructions for creating your project:

1.  [Claim](claim_repo.md) your Homework 2 repository on GitHub.
2.  Create a new RStudio project (select version control option). Pay very careful attention to the folder on your computer where you create the project. You should be able to navigate to this folder in your file browser. If you are using a USB flash drive, create the new project right on your flash drive.
3.  Create a README file for the new repository.
4.  Create a new R script for the homework assignment, e.g. `hw2.R`.

Asssignment
-----------

You will complete Chapters 2 and 3 in Getting Started with R, with a few modifications.

Here is an overview of the steps you should take:

### Chapter 2

#### Section 2.1

Read through this section but don't actually do *An excercise in data preparation*. Just read about it.

#### Section 2.2

Download the complete set of datasets from <http://www.r4all.org/the-book/datasets/>. It doesn't matter where, but if you're using your own laptop put it somewhere you can refind it so you don't have to do this again next week.

**Unzip the downloaded `.zip` file.** For example, in Windows, right click the file and select "Extract here".

Look in the extracted folder and find `compensation.csv`. Copy that file and paste it into your project folder (the one you created during project setup above). It should now appear in your Files tab in RStudio.

In section 2.2.1, don't actually create the file `DataImportExample.R`, but instead use the `hw2.R` script you created during Project setup above.

Read all four methods for importing data, but don't do any of them yet. After you've read all four methods, you can do one of the following:

1.  Use Method 1 as described in the book. Importantly, don't miss the part about copying the first two lines of code in the preview box and pasting them into your R script.
2.  Just use this code at the top of your R script:

    library(readr) compensation &lt;- read\_csv("compensation.csv")

#### Section 2.3

All of this code should go in your R script. Be liberal with you use of comments in your R script. They will help you remember what each function does, and they will help your instructor and peer reviewers know that you understood what your code actually does.

Note: in the book, there are lines of R code followed by other lines that start with two pound signs `##`. The lines prefixed with `##` are not code you should type in your R script! Rather this is the output you should expect to see in your R console when you run the line of code above it.

#### The rest

Read sections 2.4 and 2.5. If you're feeling overwhelmed, skip the Appendix. If you feel up to it and you want a better idea of how to import messy data (you might be doing this with your own dataset soon), then go ahead and read it.

### Chapter 3

Go through all of Chapter 3. If you are feeling completely lost, that's ok. We'll be going through many of these dplyr functions again in the next few weeks.

What to turn in
---------------

Your repository should end up with the following five files in it:

1.  the R project file `hw2-username.Rproj`
2.  an R script `hw2.R`
3.  the dataset `compensation.csv`
4.  a README file `README.md` for the repository
5.  `.gitignore`
