# Lab Reports

Guidelines for writing your lab reports as RMarkdown documents rendered into GitHub Flavored Markdown documents.

## YAML header

This is a basic template for the YAML header for a lab report.


``` md
---
title: "Title"
author: "Author"
date: now
format: gfm
editor: visual
---
```


### Some common mistakes

- The title and author must be quoted (surrounded by double quotes)
- The keys (title, author, date, format, editor, etc) must be lower case
- The values (now, gfm, visual, etc) must be lower case
