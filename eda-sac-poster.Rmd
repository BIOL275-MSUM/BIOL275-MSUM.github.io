# SAC Poster

## Elements

Your poster should contain the following elements:

-   Heading information

    -   MSUM logo

    -   Your project title

    -   Your name, the names of any coauthors, and your instructor's name

    -   The affiliation of each author (department, university, and address). You only need to give each unique affiliation once.

    -   The following headings:

        -   Abstract

        -   Introduction

        -   Methods

        -   Results

        -   Discussion

        -   References

        -   Acknowledgments (if necessary)

## Format and Style

- Use a [scientific writing style](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bes2.1258).

- Keep sentences fairly short.

- Don't put more than about three sentences per paragraph. This makes it easier to read in an online format.

## Template

To create your poster, you should create a README.Rmd. Use the following template as guide to get you started.

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)

## Visual Editor

Once you have a template, the easiest way to write and style your poster is to use the Visual Editor. This allows you to use common text editor buttons to format your text, insert code chunks, images, and links, and more.

To switch to the visual editor, open your README.Rmd file and click the gear icon at the top of the source pane. Check "Use Visual Editor".

The Visual Editor requires RStudio version 1.4 or later. You can check your RStudio version by running `RStudio.Version()` . If you don't have it, update RStudio by installing the newest version.

If you don't want to use the Visual Editor, you can always format your poster using RMarkdown syntax. See [R Markdown Documents](r-markdown-documents.html) for more info.

## Introduction

Your introduction should:

- Provide relevant background information

- Clearly identify the problem or question you plan to address

- State the wider implications for answering this question

- Cite relevant information

- Include helpful images or diagrams

## Methods

The methods section should include paragraphs related to:

- **Data Acquisition**. In paragraph or list form, describe how you obtained the data. Be specific... which websites did you go to, did you select which data to download, did you have to request access, etc. Use in-text citations to cite your data sources... find on their websites how to cite them appropriately. Put full references in your literature cite.

- **Data Preparation**. In paragraph or list form, describe how you cleaned up the data in preparation for your analyses.

- Citations should include:

    - R
    - RStudio
    - any R packages from the tidyverse you used (e.g. readr, dply, ggplot2)
    - any R packages you used to access data


## Results

Your results should contain short paragraphs describing the patterns you found in your data, each followed by a corresponding graph.

- Do not show any code, just figures

- Explain what each figure shows, not what it is. For example, instead of saying a figure is a histogram, say that it shows that the variable in question has a normal distribution and give the approximate mean and standard deviation.

## Discussion

The discussoin should interpret your results and tie them back to the literature and the information gap you identified in the introduction.

You should state the implications of what you found, and what follow-up steps could be undertaken.

## References

You should have a section titled "References" containing a list of references you cite in your poster.

Entries in the References section are commonly called "end citations", while citations in the text of your poster are called "in-text citations". Each each in-text citation should have a corresponding end citation and vice versa.

There are three types of references you may cite:

1.  **Primary literature**. Published peer-reviewed journal articles. Articles from the popular press (e.g. a magazine, blog, or news website) should not be used.
2.  **Data sources**. Where you obtained your data from.
3.  **Software**. Including R, RStudio, and any R packages you used.

### Citing software

R makes it easy to cite software by giving you the citations to use. You can find full citations for R using:

```{r}
citation()
```

Always give the version of R and RStudio you are using. In the text of your methods, you would say something like "I used R Version 4.0.3 (R Core Team 2021)"

To find your version of R type:

```{r}
R.Version()
```

The citation and version number for RStudio can be found like this:

```{r rstudio-citation, eval=FALSE}
RStudio.Version()
```

Citations for R packages can be found like this:

```{r}
citation("dplyr")
```

You should any non-base packages you use. For example, cite any of the tidyverse package (tibble, dplyr, tidyr, forcats, lubridate, readr), but do not cite the tidyverse package itself.

If you use a special package for reading in data, cite is, e.g. readxl.

If you read data from online using a special package, cite it too, e.g. rgbif, rinat, BIEN, auk.

### End citation format

Use the format defined by the Council of Science Editors.

### In-text citation format

In-text citations should be given in the Name-Year format. Examples:

1.  One author: (Merkord 2021)
2.  Two authors: (Merkord and Merkord 2021)
3.  Three authors: (Merkord et al. 2021)
