# Get RStudio {-}

Your first task is to choose how you will work with R. To do that, you should understand the difference between R and RStudio, and know what your options are for running RStudio.

## About R and RStudio {-}

**R** is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. Today, R is the most commonly used software for data analysis in the biological sciences.

While it is possible to run R by itself, it is more common to run it as part of **RStudio**, a free and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for R. For most uses, it's best to use RStudio rather than R directly.

To get started with RStudio Desktop, you need to first install R, then install RStudio.

## Install R {-}

You must install R before you install RStudio.

Directions for installing R:
