## Overview

A major part of the lab will be to develop your own data science project in R.

You will choose a dataset to use and a question to answer. You will present your results to the class and at the [MSUMâ€™s Andrew B. Conteh Student Academic Conference (SAC)](https://www.mnstate.edu/sac/) in April (application deadline is Feb. 25).

## Purpose

The purpose of the lab project is to provide you an opportunity to learn how to work with data, explore datasets, and perform statistical analyses in R while trying to answer a question that interests _you_.

## Datasets

You may choose one of the following datasets, or choose another publicly available dataset, or use your own dataset, for example if you are involved in an ongoing research project.

### Your own dataset

If you are involved in an ongoing research project, for example with a faculty member at MSUM, you may be able to use the data collected as part of that project for your BIOL 275 lab project.

In order for you to choose your own dataset, it must be approved by the instructor first. In general, it needs to have enough data to be able to answer an interesting question.

### An MSUM Biosciences dataset

Many faculty in the Biosciences Department conduct research with undergraduate.

At the moment, these are the available datasets you may choose:

- **Neuroscience experiment from the Stocker Lab**. Dr. Stocker is exploring the effect of particular genes on brain development and behavior in mice. His dataset includes the results of a behavioral experiment.

### Public datasets

Here are some ideas for public datasets. You will have only a short time to acquire your dataset.

- **[Dryad](http://datadryad.org/)**. A curated, general purpose data repository. You can search through it to find an interesting dataset. Here are two examples:
    - **[Mammal community data from Wen _et al._ (2018)](http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.170813 )**. A dataset of mammal species found at sites along an elevational gradient on three mountains in China.
    - **[Birth seasonality data from Martinez-Bakker _et al._ (2014)](http://hdl.handle.net/10255/dryad.170822)**. A dataset of the number of births per month over the past 100 years in the US and 60 years in the World. Could possible be combined with another dataset to ask an interesting question.
- **[County Health Rankings & Roadmaps](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/)**. A source of annual county-level public health data. You can download data by state and year (see [Minnesota](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/minnesota/2017/downloads), for example).
- **[KIDS COUNT](http://datacenter.kidscount.org/)**. A source of data on children and families and a project of the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Data is available by year and county/state. You would need to choose and download the variables necessary to answer your question. Topics include:
    - Demographics
    - Economic Well-Being
    - Education
    - Family and Community
    - Health
    - Safety and Risky Behaviors
- **[eBird data](https://ebird.org/science)** on bird observations. This is a huge dataset with many possible questions to explore. Possibilities include:
    - The relationship between abundance of a species and specific environmental conditions (e.g. climate, land cover)
    - The relationship between birding effort and number/diversity of birds observed
- The **Botanical Information and Ecology Network** brings together data on plant distribution, abundance, and traits, with the goal of predicting and mitigating the effects of climate change on plant species and communities. You can download geolocated observations and trait data, but you'd probably need to combine it with some other earth observation data like those found below.
- **Earth Observation datasets**. These are generally remote-sensing datasets in raster format. and would require slighly more time to convert to tabular format and to plot as a map.
    - **[National Land Cover Database](https://www.mrlc.gov/finddata.php)**. Could possible look at land cover change in a particular area.
    - **MODIS data for Minnesota**. This could include climate, land cover, vegetation index, or fire data. 500 m spatial resolution and 1-day, 8-day, 16-day, or monthly temporal resolution.
    - **LANDSAT data for Clay County**. This could include land cover or vegation indices. 30-m spatial resolution and 16-day temporal resolution.
    - Various vector datasets including administrative boundaries, cities, rivers, etc.

And finally, the internet has lots of other lists of datasets, for example:

- **Minnesota Health Data Sources(http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/using-the-rankings-data/finding-more-data/minnesota)**, a list compiled by County Health Rankings & Roadmaps.
- **[Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)**. A topic-centric list of high-quality open datasets in public domains. By everyone, for everyone! 

### Datasets in R

There are literally thousands of datasets available in R
